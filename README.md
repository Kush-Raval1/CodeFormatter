# Code to Image Renderer


Code to Image Renderer is a Python-based application that converts programming code into beautiful and customizable images. It uses syntax highlighting to enhance the visual representation of code snippets and provides options to select different programming languages and themes.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting: Supports a wide range of programming languages and applies syntax highlighting to code snippets for improved readability.
- Customizable themes: Choose from a variety of built-in themes to style your code images according to your preferences.
- MacOS-inspired design: Adds a sleek and modern touch to the code images by including MacOS-style buttons and window title.
- High-resolution and quality: Generates high-quality images that are indistinguishable from screenshots, making them suitable for presentations, documentation, and sharing on social media.
- User-friendly interface: Simple and intuitive user interface built with Tkinter for easy code input and image generation.
- Cross-platform compatibility: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
